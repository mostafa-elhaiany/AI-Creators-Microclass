        "\n",
        "In this section, we'll delve into the practical aspects of making API requests and handling API responses. Before we dive into the code, let's explore some fundamental concepts related to HTTP requests and response formats.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Understanding HTTP Requests\n",
        "\n",
        "When interacting with an API, you'll typically use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests to communicate with the server. HTTP requests come in several types, but the most common ones are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **GET**: Used to retrieve data from the server. You send a GET request when you want to fetch information from an API, such as retrieving weather data for a specific location.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **POST**: Used to send data to the server for processing. You send a POST request when, for example, you're submitting a form on a website or creating a new resource through an API.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **PUT**: Used to update an existing resource on the server. You send a PUT request when you want to modify information, like updating a user's profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **DELETE**: Used to request the removal of a resource from the server. You send a DELETE request when you want to delete a record, such as removing a specific item from a database.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Response Formats\n",
        "\n",
        "When you make an API request, the server sends a response back to your application. API responses are typically formatted in a standardized way to ensure easy data exchange. The most common response formats include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: JSON is a lightweight, text-based format used to transmit data between a server and a client. It's human-readable and easy to parse, making it a popular choice for APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**: XML is another text-based format that's used for data interchange. It's more verbose than JSON and has its own set of rules and tags for defining data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: HTML is mainly used for web content and rendering web pages. It can also be used for data exchange in certain cases, though it's less common for API responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we'll primarily work with JSON responses, as it's the most prevalent and user-friendly format for API interactions. We'll demonstrate how to send HTTP requests and parse JSON responses using Python's 'requests' library.\n"
